Update 7/8/2021:
Decided to get rid of the checkboxes. The hotels added to the dashboard will be compared. Now I need to implement a comparison page layout.

Figured out how to send data from js to the request. However, it is not rendering the compare page. 

Update 6/30/2021:
Still can't figure it out. However, I believe it has to do with the data I am sending to the http. Currently sending Nodelist which might be the issue.

Update 6/29/2021: 
No progress, still trying to figure out how to send data from main.js to my /compare get request.

Update 6/28/2021:
Was able to solve how to get checked hotels in my main.js file. Now I need to find out how to send the checked hotels to the /compare request.

Update 6/27/2021:
Got the checkbox working. Need to figure out how to pull the id from each checked hotel and send it to /compare request. 

Update 6/26/2021.v2:
Set up a hotel list page that will display all created hotels. The dashboard shows the user selected hotels. Need to figure out how the user
will choose which 2 hotels to compare and send it to a comparison page.

Update 6/26/2021:
Able to upload two photos now. Need to figure out how to pull correct name and details from form.
